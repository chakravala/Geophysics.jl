With the development of electricy and magentism came an interest for an additional Dimension called charge or Q. When the thermodynamics of entropy became furhter developed, the temperature or Θ was introduced as another Dimension. In the field of chemistry, it became desirable to introduce another Dimension of molaramount or N as fundamental. To complete the existing International System of Quantities (ISQ) it is also necessary to consider luminousflux or J as a visual perception related Dimension.

Therefore, the philosophy is to characterize differences among UnitSystem instances by means of dimensional constants. As a result, all the defaults are ideal modern variants of these historical unit systems based on a common underlying Universe, which are completely consistent and compatible with each other. These default UnitSystem values are to be taken as a newly defined mutually-compatible recommended standard, verified to be consistent and coherent.","category":"page"},{"location":"similitude.html#","page":"Similitude","title":"Similitude","text":"Pages = [\"unitsystems.md\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"similitude.html#Metric-SI-Unit-Systems-1","page":"Similitude","title":"Metric SI Unit Systems","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"similitude.html#","page":"Similitude","title":"Similitude","text":"In the Systeme International d'Unites (the SI units) the UnitSystem constants are derived from the most accurate possible physical measurements and a few exactly defined constants.

Therefore, the philosophy is to characterize differences among UnitSystem instances by means of dimensional constants. As a result, all the defaults are ideal modern variants of these historical unit systems based on a common underlying Universe, which are completely consistent and compatible with each other.
